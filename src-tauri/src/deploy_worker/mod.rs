//! Lab operations that outlive the app. A launch, a resume, a pause or shutdown, a provisioning
//! run and an attack VM start each run in a detached worker process: this same executable,
//! headless (`cyberctf-desktop deploy --job <file>`), in its own process group, with its output
//! in a log file. Quitting, crashing or rebuilding the app never cuts a `vagrant up`, a `compose
//! up` or a `terraform apply` short. The app only follows the worker's log; "in progress" is a
//! live pidfile, so a relaunched app sees the operation and re-attaches to its log.
//!
//! Files, under `<app data>/deploys/`, keyed by the lab (`<lab>`) or, for its attack VM, which
//! runs beside the lab's own operation, `<lab>.attack`: `<key>.json` (the job), `<key>.log`
//! (what the worker says, also its stdout/stderr), `<key>.pid` (the worker, while it runs),
//! `<key>.status` (`ok` or `error: ...`, written last).
