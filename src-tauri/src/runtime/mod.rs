//! Lab runtimes. A lab is a directory under `<app data>/labs/<lab id>/` with an `isoloom.yml`
//! at its root; the files of the target it runs on are generated under its `.isoloom/` (see
//! `lab`). The UI only ever passes a lab id and a runtime; paths and commands are built here.
//!
//! - `launch`: starting a lab, here or on a server host.
//! - `lifecycle`: park, resume, provision, stop, and the expired-lab reaper.
//! - `status`: what a lab looks like right now, wherever it runs.
//! - `attack_box`, `shell`: the player's attacker beside a lab, and the shells into it.
//! - `commands`: the Tauri commands over all of the above.
//! - `inflight`, `paths`, `remote`: the per-lab lock and in-flight registry, a lab's files and
//!   markers, and SSH to a lab host.
